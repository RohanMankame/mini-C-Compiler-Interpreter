# mini-C-Compiler-Interpreter
A complete compiler and interpreter for a small programming language called "minic". The compiler processes source code written in "minic", checks it for errors, and then executes it. This involves several classic compiler stages including Lexical Analysis (Lexing), Syntax Analysis (Parsing), Semantic Analysis and Execution (Interpretation)
